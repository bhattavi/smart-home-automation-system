# Smart Home Automation System

## Overview

The Smart Home Automation System is a comprehensive project designed to empower users with the ability to control and monitor various aspects of their homes. It includes features such as lighting control, climate management, security, energy optimization, voice control, and a web-based dashboard for centralized control and monitoring.

## Key Features

- **Mobile App (React Native):** A user-friendly mobile application for Android and iOS, enabling remote control and real-time monitoring of smart home devices.

- **Voice Control:** Implementation of voice recognition capabilities, enabling users to control devices with natural language commands.

- **Smart Lighting:** Control individual lights or groups of lights, create lighting schedules, and integrate with motion sensors for energy efficiency.

- **Climate Control:** Integration with smart thermostats and HVAC systems for precise temperature and humidity management and energy-efficient climate scheduling.

- **Security:** Real-time camera feeds, door/window sensors, motion detectors, and notifications and alerts for enhanced home security.

- **Energy Management:** Insights into energy consumption and the ability to optimize energy usage by controlling devices and setting energy-saving profiles.

- **Interoperability:** Compatibility with a wide range of smart home protocols and devices, including Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, and integration with IoT platforms like Google Home and Amazon Alexa.

- **Data Analytics:** Data collection from sensors and user interactions, providing insights and recommendations for automation and energy savings.

- **Web Dashboard:** A web-based dashboard accessible from a computer for monitoring and controlling the smart home.

## Technical Stack

- **Mobile App (React Native):** Developed using JavaScript/TypeScript with React Native.

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express for server-side functionality.

- **Database:** MongoDB for data storage.

- **Web Dashboard:** Frontend implemented with React for a responsive and interactive user interface.

- **Voice Recognition:** Integrated with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa for natural language voice commands.

- **IoT Protocols:** Utilizes MQTT and REST APIs for device communication.

- **Security:** End-to-end encryption, robust authentication, and authorization mechanisms to ensure user privacy and data security.

## Getting Started

To set up the Smart Home Automation System locally for development or testing, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
- Install MongoDB for data storage.
- Set up the necessary dependencies for React Native mobile app development.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-home-automation-system.git

2. Set up the backend server:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm start

3. Set up the web-based dashboard:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start

4. Set up the mobile app:

    ```bash
    cd mobile-app
    npm install
    npx react-native run-ios  # For iOS
    npx react-native run-android  # For Android

## Usage

Access the web-based dashboard by opening a browser and navigating to http://localhost:3000.

Install the mobile app on your Android or iOS device to control and monitor your smart home from anywhere.
